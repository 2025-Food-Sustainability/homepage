 = What would stop you from eating out?
 Fear of being judged as “too eco‑centric” by peers.
 Lack of traditional disposable items (e.g., straws, napkins) would inconvenience me.
 Portion sizes might be smaller.
 Service speed might suffer due to extra prep steps.
 Dining companions may not approve.
 Prices are higher than comparable restaurants.
Menu choice could be too limited.
Food‑safety or hygiene standards might be lower.
